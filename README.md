CCLights 2 is a Open Source Minecraft mod that adds a Peripheral for ComputerCraft. The GPU Peripheral is capable of rendering draw commands and outputting them to a Monitor, which has a right clickable GUI to use your mouse and keyboard to control actions. This allows for a whole new experience for ComputerCraft.
TODO:
-  Add in-world monitors (Similar to CCLights 1)
-  Fix any bugs with texture binding
-  Make Network code more efficent (Note: This should never be checked off, because the network code always needs to be more efficent)
